# Kingkit is a rootkit designed for KOTH on tryhackme

### usage

Compile the rootkit with:
```
gcc kingkit.c -shared -fPIC -ldl -o kingkit.so
```
Then you can install the rootkit with:
```
cp ./kingkit.so /lib/kingkit.so
echo "/lib/kingkit.so" > /etc/ld.so.preload
```
Because of conflicting glibc versions you need to compile the rootkit on the machine where you want to run it, otherwise it can break the machine. Also make sure to change the macro KING_NAME to your own nickname.


### features
* [x] Block any writing to king.txt
* [x] Redirect writes to /etc/ld.so.preload to FAKE_PRELOAD
* [x] Block writing to LIB_PATH and FAKE_PRELOAD
* [x] Write name to king.txt and protect it
* [x] Hiding files and directories starting with HIDE_PREFIX
* [ ] Reverse shell persistence
* [ ] Hiding processes and connections from netstat, ps and lsof
* [ ] Automatic restoration of the library after deletion


### remove LD_PRELOAD rootkits
While LD_PRELOAD rootkits are very powerful, they have a critical weakness: static binaries are not affected. So to remove a LD_PRELOAD rootkit all you need is a static binary that removes the /etc/ld.so.preload file. To make things easier for you this repository already includes a static binary that removes the /etc/ld.so.preload file, run it with: `chmod +x remove && ./remove`. You can also compile it from source with `gcc remove.c -static -o remove`. Apart from the /etc/ld.so.preload file the LD_PRELOAD environment variable can also be used to load the malicious library. The environment variable can be removed with: `unset LD_PRELOAD`.
