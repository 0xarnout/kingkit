# Kingkit is a rootkit designed for KOTH on tryhackme

### usage

Compile the rootkit with:
```
gcc kingkit.c -shared -fPIC -ldl -o kingkit.so
```
Then you can install the rootkit with:
```
cp ./kingkit.so /lib/kingkit.so
echo "/lib/kingkit.so" > /etc/ld.so.preload
```
Because of conflicting glibc versions you need to compile the rootkit on a koth machine. The easiest option is to compile on the food machine because it is available as a room, after you compiled it you can use that binary on all koth machines. Also make sure to change the macro KING_NAME to your own nickname.


### features
* [x] Block any writing to king.txt
* [x] Redirect writes to /etc/ld.so.preload to FAKE_PRELOAD
* [x] Block writing to LIB_PATH and FAKE_PRELOAD
* [x] Write name to king.txt and protect it
* [x] Hiding files and directories starting with HIDE_PREFIX
* [x] Reverse shell persistence
* [ ] Hiding processes and connections from netstat, ps and lsof
* [ ] Automatic restoration of the library after deletion


### reverse shell
The rootkit can spawn a reverse shell every minute by hooking the time() function in cron. To use this feature you have to change the HOST and PORT macros to your vpn ip address and the port netcat (or a different tool) is listening on. Additionally you have to restart the cron daemon so the rootkit is loaded by cron, to do that run `systemctl restart cron` on the box after the rootkit is installed.


### remove LD_PRELOAD rootkits
While LD_PRELOAD rootkits are very powerful, they have a critical weakness: static binaries are not affected. So to remove a LD_PRELOAD rootkit all you need is a static binary that removes the /etc/ld.so.preload file. To make things easier for you this repository already includes a static binary that removes the /etc/ld.so.preload file, run it with: `chmod +x remove && ./remove`. You can also compile it from source with `gcc remove.c -static -o remove`. Apart from the /etc/ld.so.preload file the LD_PRELOAD environment variable can also be used to load the malicious library. The environment variable can be removed with: `unset LD_PRELOAD`.
